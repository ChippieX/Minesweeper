This is the hit game minesweeper, programmed using c++ and SFML, over the course of my summer because I wanted to keep using SFML over the summer lol

Okay so a few things:

1) I dont know what im doing at all so idk if the exe will actually run properly for other people or not, if it doesnt wind up working you can either clone this into visual studio (since all of the project files are here) or just build the cpp somewhere else but YOU WILL NEED SFML to do that
2) I suck at programming and i'm sorry if it shows (because it does)
