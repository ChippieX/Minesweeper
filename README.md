This is the hit game Minesweeper, programmed using C++ and SFML, over the course of my summer because I wanted to keep using SFML over the summer lol

Okay, so a few things:

1) I don't know what I'm doing at all so I don't know if the exe will actually run properly for other people or not, if it doesn't wind up working you can either clone this into Visual Studio (since all of the project files are here) or just build the cpp somewhere else but YOU WILL NEED SFML to do that and make sure you change the property settings
2) I suck at programming and I'm sorry if it shows (because it does)
